Solitaire
=========

This was developed for Data Structure and Algorithms at AUT.

It doesn't require D&D.
The game logic is completed.

It also uses sound from swing. It currently only can use .wav files. 
There is no sound file included. If you want to use it, you must specify your own .wav file and make slight changes.

This assignment was implemented as a MVC practice.
I'm proud to say this is my first completed MVC implementation.


Further improvement can be:
1.to use MouseMotionListener to handle D&D(Drag and Drop) feature.
2.Further game logic fix
3.Add an ending when user wins.
